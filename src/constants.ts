  <p>Welcome,<br>
  My name is Staz.<br>
  I am a Frontend (mostly) engineer and have been working with React and Typescript mainly.<br>
  I like to build things with AI, like this page for example uses GPT to generate the background image, as well as to power the chat bot where you can ask me questions about my work, hobbies, or anything else.</p>
